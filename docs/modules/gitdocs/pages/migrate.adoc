= Migrate directory to another repo

Migrate a directory retaining its directory name to another repo, new or existing.

In most examples that you find on the web, you only migrate the files and not the parent directory, which can be hard to identify aftwards which files have migrated.

This procedure is taken from link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32940679/how-do-i-git-subtree-split-but-maintain-the-full-folder-hierarchy[stackoverflow]

. In the source repo:
+
[,console]
----
~$ git co -b <anybranchname> 
~$ git filter-branch --index-filter \
    'git ls-files \
       | grep -v "^yourdirtomigrate/\|^path/to/parents/" \
       | xargs --no-run-if-empty git rm --cached' \
    HEAD
----
+
NOTE:: If the directory is in the root of your repo, then only `^yourdirtomigrate/`, remove everything until the next `"`, so remove `\|^path/to/parents/`.

. In the target repo:
+
[,console]
----
~$ git remote add <anyname> /path/to/source/repo
~$ git pull <anyname> <anybranchname>
----
+
If you get an error with options you can do, execute `git config pull.rebase true` and repeat the `git pull` command.

Your directory is now copied to the target repository.
