= Pre-commit hooks

You can create pre-commit hooks to ensure that the content that you want to commit contains specific strings.

If any of these strings are missing, you cannot commit, an overview of all missing items will be shown.

. In your project, go to the directory .git/hooks, f.e. *myproject\.git\hooks*.
+
NOTE:: .git is a hidden folder

. Remove the extension .sample from the file *pre-commit.sample*.
. Open the file for editing and replace all content with the content below.
. Save and close the file.

In the following sample pre-commit hook, all htm files (to be defined in `FILES` line) will be checked if they contain specific strings. These strings are defined in the `checks` list of the sample code.

[,bash]
----
#!/bin/sh

checks=("meta name=\"category\"" "MadCap:concept" "MadCap:keyword") # create an array
FILES="\.htm(\..+)?$" # List only htm files
COUNTER=0 #Counter for errors in commit
RED="\033[0;31m"
GREEN="\033[0;32m"
NC="\033[0m"

echo "Running pre-commit hook"
git diff --cached --name-status | egrep "$FILES" | while read flag file; do
if [ "$flag" == 'D' ]; then continue; fi

    for word in "${checks[@]}"
    do
        if egrep -q "$word" "$file"; then
            echo -e "OK: \"${word}\" in file: ${file}"
        else
            echo -e "ERROR: \"${word}\" is missing in file: ${file}" >&2
            COUNTER=$((COUNTER+1))
        fi
    done

    if [ "$COUNTER" -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "All good, committing files..."
        exit 0
        else
            echo "===="
            echo "$COUNTER errors detected"
            exit 1
    fi
done
